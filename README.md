# Futhark-Video: A Saga of Runic Elegance


Hail, warriors and skalds! Behold, Futhark-Video, a netrūn that melds the ancient wisdom of runic script with the prowess of modern video craft. Forged in the fires of Next.js and Remotion, this project weaves letters into the sacred Futhark, breathing life into dynamic videos that resonate with the echoes of our Nordic ancestors.


Work in Progress: The longship is still under construction! Stay tuned for the grand unveiling of Netrūn, our digital hall where the runes of the modern age come to life! Skål! 🍻
